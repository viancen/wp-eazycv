		Now this is the story all about how my life got flipped, turned upside down and Id like to take a minute just sit right there Ill tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air  In West Philadelphia born and raised on the playground where I spent most of my days chilling out, maxing, relaxing all cool and all shooting some b-ball outside of the school when a couple of guys said "were up in no good" started making trouble in my neighbourhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scared and said "youre moving with your aunte and uncle in Bel-Air"  I begged and pleaded with her the other day but she packed my suitcase and sent me on my way she gave me a kissin and she gave me my ticket I put my walkman on and said I might aswell kick it  First class, yo this is bad, drinking orange juice out of a champagne glass is this what the people of Bel-Air livin like, hmm this might be alright!  I whistled for a cab and when it came near the licensplate said "Fresh" and had a dice in the mirror if anything I could say that this cab was rare but I thought now forget it, yo home to Bel-Air  I pulled up to a house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabby "Yo, home smell you later" looked at my kingdom I was finally there to settle my throne as the prince of Bel-Air '
